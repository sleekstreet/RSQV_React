# Ron Swanson Quote Voter React Example

This example shows how I would use react to create a simple quote voter app. This example uses react next.js framework.

The bulk of the example is located on the main index page `pages/index.js`. All of the components are located in the component folder. 

The latest updates to this example is controling the amount of quotes that are available to this small grid by using the select dropdown in the header. The next updates for this example will be some adding some stylings to make this example look nice.
